# Library Management System (Java)

A simple console-based Java program to manage a library. This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and basic **Java collections** (`ArrayList`).

## Features
- Add new books to the library
- Display all available books
- Issue books to students
- Return issued books
- Search for books by title

---

## How It Works
1. The program uses a `Book` class to store book information (ID, title, author, and status).
2. The `Library` class manages the list of books and provides methods to perform operations.
3. Users interact with the system via a **simple menu** in the console.
